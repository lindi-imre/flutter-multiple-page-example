# tester_project

Hey, this is my flutter test project to check how multiple pages works in flutter.

## Getting Started

I just simple created a bottom navigation bar, there are four buttons in the nav bar but you can switch only between chat and dashboard page.
If you want to create something similar, you need to check the home, dashoard and chat.dart files.

Click to the start if that was useful for you.
